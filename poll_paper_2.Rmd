*Find a poll that asks questions relevant to your policy area. Write a paper (no more than 600 words) summarizing and analyzing the results of the survey. What do the results suggest about public opinion on your policy? Has public opinion been changing? How is this likely to play into policy outcomes in your policy area? Be prepared to tell the class about the survey findings.*

In a March 2018 Gallup poll, 53% of the 1,041 respondents indicated that they were in favor of "passing a carbon tax to encourage reductions in carbon dioxide emissions." (Figure 1, Gallup 2018)

![](figures/figure1.png)

While Gallup had not previously polled on this question, it and several others on potential government  environmental policies were added as part of an ongoing poll. That poll was started in 1992 and asked participants how they felt the US federal government was doing in its response to environmental issues (Figure 2) and, starting in 2001, whether the federal government should prioritize environmental protection or energy production (Figure 3).
